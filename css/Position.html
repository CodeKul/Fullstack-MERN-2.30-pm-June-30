<!-- 
    The goal is to create 4 pages, each page has 4 paragraphs of text. Assign a unique positioning value to the third paragraph. For example, the "position-static.html" page will have a value of "static" as the position value, while the "position-relative.html" page has a position value of "relative".

I recommend you name the files:
"position-static.html"
"position-relative.html"
"position-absolute.html"
"position-fixed.html" -->
